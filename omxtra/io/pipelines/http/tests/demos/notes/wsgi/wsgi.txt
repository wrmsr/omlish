====

environ:
REQUEST_METHOD - The HTTP request method, such as "GET" or "POST". This cannot ever be an empty string, and so is always required.
SCRIPT_NAME - The initial portion of the request URL’s “path” that corresponds to the application object, so that the application knows its virtual “location”. This may be an empty string, if the application corresponds to the “root” of the server.
PATH_INFO - The remainder of the request URL’s “path”, designating the virtual “location” of the request’s target within the application. This may be an empty string, if the request URL targets the application root and does not have a trailing slash.
QUERY_STRING - The portion of the request URL that follows the "?", if any. May be empty or absent.
CONTENT_TYPE - The contents of any Content-Type fields in the HTTP request. May be empty or absent.
CONTENT_LENGTH - The contents of any Content-Length fields in the HTTP request. May be empty or absent.
SERVER_NAME, SERVER_PORT - When HTTP_HOST is not set, these variables can be combined to determine a default. See the URL Reconstruction section below for more detail. SERVER_NAME and SERVER_PORT are required strings and must never be empty.
SERVER_PROTOCOL - The version of the protocol the client used to send the request. Typically this will be something like "HTTP/1.0" or "HTTP/1.1" and may be used by the application to determine how to treat any HTTP request headers. (This variable should probably be called REQUEST_PROTOCOL, since it denotes the protocol used in the request, and is not necessarily the protocol that will be used in the server’s response. However, for compatibility with CGI we have to keep the existing name.)
HTTP_ Variables - Variables corresponding to the client-supplied HTTP request headers (i.e., variables whose names begin with "HTTP_"). The presence or absence of these variables should correspond with the presence or absence of the appropriate HTTP header in the request.
