- undo `__str__`, bad idea, go with explicit def string(self) -> str
  - or 'def render'?
  - 'done'? verify
- deal with hilarious buffer management inefficiency
- actually test
- promote to prod
- exceptions lol
- amalg-safe - finish 'yaml_' de-namespacifying everything
- final bit of actually constructing objects from asts - fully diverge from go-yaml here
