== Heaviest living animals ==
The heaviest living animals are all [[whale]]s. Since no scale can accommodate the whole body of a large whale, most have been weighed by parts.

=====Heaviest living bird species=====
The following is a list of the heaviest living bird species based on maximum reported or reliable mass, but average weight is also given for comparison. These species are almost all flightless, which allows for these particular birds to have denser bones and heavier bodies. Flightless birds comprise less than 2% of all living bird species.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

====Thaliacea====
[[File:Pyrosoma_atlanticum.JPG|thumb|right|The ''[[Pyrosoma atlanticum]]'' is the largest thaliacean.]]
The largest [[thaliacea]]n, ''[[Pyrosoma atlanticum]]'', is cylindrical and can grow up to 60&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;ft) long and 4–6&nbsp;cm wide. The constituent [[zooid]]s form a rigid tube, which may be pale pink, yellowish, or bluish. One end of the tube is narrower and is closed, while the other is open and has a strong diaphragm. The outer surface or test is gelatinised and dimpled with backward-pointing, blunt processes. The individual zooids are up to {{cvt|8.5|mm|in}} long and have a broad, rounded branchial sac with [[gill]] slits. Along the side of the branchial sac runs the [[endostyle]], which produces [[mucus]] filters. Water is moved through the gill slits into the centre of the cylinder by [[Cilium|cilia]] pulsating rhythmically. [[Plankton]] and other food particles are caught in mucus filters in the processes as the colony is propelled through the water. ''P. atlanticum'' is bioluminescent and can generate a brilliant blue-green light when stimulated.<ref name=JelliesZone/><ref>[http://species-identification.org/species.php?species_group=zmns&id=588 ''Pyrosoma atlanticum''] Marine Species Identification Portal.

Like all [[tunicate]]s, they are [[filter feeder]]s. They are free-floating; the same forced flow of water through their bodies with which they gather [[plankton]] is used for propulsion - not unlike a tiny [[ramjet]] engine. Doliolids are capable of quick movement. They have a complicated [[biological life cycle|lifecycle]] consisting of sexual and asexual generations. They are nearly exclusively tropical animals, although a few species are found as far north as northern [[California]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}
;Salps ([[Salpida]])
:The largest salp is ''[[Cyclosalpa bakeri]]'' 15cm (6ins) long. There are openings at the anterior and posterior ends of the cylinder which can be opened or closed as needed. The bodies have seven transverse bands of muscle interspersed by white, translucent patches. A stolon grows from near the endostyle (an elongated glandular structure producing mucus for trapping food particles). The stolon is a ribbon-like organ on which a batch of aggregate forms of the animal are produced by [[budding]]. The aggregate is the second, colonial form of the salp and is also gelatinous, transparent and flabby. It takes the shape of a radial whorl of individuals up to about 20cm (4in) in diameter.

====Insects (Insecta)====
[[File:Goliathus goliatus dos.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Goliath beetle]]]]
[[Insect]]s, a [[Class (biology)|class]] of [[Arthropod]]a, are easily the most numerous class of organisms, with over one million identified species, and probably many undescribed species. The heaviest insect is almost certainly a species of [[Coleoptera|beetle]], which incidentally is the most species-rich order of organisms. Although heavyweight [[giant weta]]s (''[[Deinacrida heteracantha]]'') are known, the [[elephant beetle]]s of Central and South America, (''[[Megasoma elephas]]'') and (''[[Megasoma actaeon|M. actaeon]]''), the [[Titan beetle]] (''Titanus giganteus'') of the neotropical rainforest or the [[Goliathus|Goliath beetle]]s, (''[[Goliathus goliatus]]'') and (''[[Goliathus regius|G. regius]]''), of Africa's rainforest are thought to reach a higher weight.<ref name="weta">{{cite web |url=http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_30.shtml |title=Largest |access-date=10 June 2009 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718140051/http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_30.shtml |archive-date=18 July 2011 }}(2011). source: The University of Florida Book of Insect Records {{cite web |url=http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_30.shtml |title=Largest |access-date=10 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820232404/http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_30.shtml |archive-date=20 August 2014 }}</ref> The most frequently crowned are the Goliath beetles, the top known size of which is at least {{convert|100|g|oz|abbr=on}} and {{convert|11.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name = "Wood"/> The elephant beetles and titan beetle can reach greater lengths than the Goliath, at up to {{convert|13.1|and|15.2|cm|in|abbr=on}}, respectively, but this is in part thanks to their rather large horns. The Goliath beetle's wingspan can range up to {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name = "Wood"/>

Some moths and butterflies have much larger areas than the heaviest beetles, but weigh a fraction as much.

The longest insects are the stick insects, see below.

Representatives of the extinct dragonfly-like [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Meganisoptera]], such as the [[Carboniferous]] ''[[Meganeura monyi]]'' of what is now France and the [[Permian]] ''[[Meganeuropsis permiana]]'' of what is now North America, are the largest [[insect]] species known to have existed. These creatures had a wingspan of some {{convert|75|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a mass of over {{convert|1|lb|g}}, making them about the size of a [[crow]].<ref name = "Wood"/>

Another fairly large species is the [[Hercules beetle]] (''Dynastes hercules'') of the neotropic rainforest with a maximum overall length of at least {{convert|19|cm|in|abbr=on}} including the extremely long pronotal horn.
