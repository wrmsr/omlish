class LongestMatchDelimiterFramer:
    """
    A delimiter-based framing codec that supports *overlapping* delimiters with longest-match semantics.

    This is intentionally decoupled from any I/O model: it operates purely on a `BytesBuffer`-like object (providing
    `__len__`, `find`, `split_to`, `advance`, and `segments`/`peek`).

    Key property:
      Given overlapping delimiters like [b'\\r', b'\\r\\n'], this codec will *not* emit a frame ending at '\\r' unless
      it can prove the next byte is not '\\n' (or the stream is finalized).

    Implementation note:
      This codec relies on `BytesBuffer.find(...)` being stream-correct and C-accelerated over the buffer's underlying
      contiguous segments. In pure Python it is usually better to keep searching near the storage layer than to
      re-implement scanning byte-by-byte in higher-level codecs.

        Consume as many complete frames as possible from `buf` and return them as views.

        - Frames are produced without copying (via `buf.split_to(...)`) when possible.
        - The delimiter is consumed from the buffer; it may be retained on the frame if `keep_ends=True`.
        - If `final=True`, the codec will not defer on overlapping delimiter prefixes at the end of the buffer.

        Raises:
          - BufferTooLarge if no delimiter is present and the buffered prefix exceeds max_size.
          - FrameTooLarge if the next frame payload (bytes before delimiter) exceeds max_size.

        Note on `max_size`:
          `max_size` is enforced as a limit on the *current* frame (bytes before the next delimiter). If the buffer
          contains bytes for a subsequent frame that already exceed `max_size`, this codec will only raise when it would
          otherwise need to make progress on that oversized frame. Concretely: if this call already emitted at least one
          frame, it will return those frames rather than raising immediately on trailing oversized data, leaving the
          remaining bytes buffered.
