        that can parse headers from an initial contiguous region.

    A read-only, possibly non-contiguous view of bytes.

    This is the result type of operations like `BytesBuffer.split_to()`: it represents a *logical* byte sequence without
    requiring a copy. A `BytesView` is intentionally minimal: it is not a general-purpose container API, not a
    random-access sequence, and not intended for arbitrary indexing/slicing-heavy use.

    `BytesView` exists to make copy boundaries explicit:
      - Use `segments()` / `peek()` to access data without copying.
      - Use `tobytes()` (or `bytes(view)`) to intentionally materialize a contiguous `bytes` object.

    Implementations may be backed by one or many `memoryview` segments; the semantics are defined as if all readable
    bytes were concatenated in order.

class BytesBuffer(BytesViewLike, ta.Protocol):
    """
    An incremental, consumption-oriented byte accumulator intended for protocol parsing.

    A `BytesBuffer` is a *stream buffer*: bytes are appended by a driver/transport and then consumed by codecs via
    peeking, searching, splitting, and advancing-without forcing repeated concatenation or reallocation. It is
    explicitly designed to support segmented storage (to avoid "a huge buffer pinned by a tiny tail") and to enable
    low-copy pipeline-style decoding (Netty/Tokio-inspired).

    What it is for:
      - buffering raw bytes between I/O and protocol codecs,
      - framing (delimiters/length-prefixed) using split/advance,
      - efficient searching over buffered bytes using C-accelerated primitives via `memoryview` segments.

    What it is *not* for:
      - a general-purpose replacement for `bytes`/`bytearray`,
      - a `collections.abc.Sequence` or random-access container abstraction,
      - arbitrary indexing/slicing-heavy workloads (use `bytes`/`bytearray`/`memoryview` directly).

    `BytesBuffer` deliberately exposes `memoryview` at its boundary. This is foundational: it allows both immutable
    (`bytes`) and mutable (`bytearray`) internal storage to be viewed in O(1) without copying. It also avoids relying
    on `io.BytesIO` as a core backing store: while `BytesIO.getbuffer()` can expose a view, exported views pin the
    underlying buffer against resizing, which makes it awkward as a general-purpose buffer substrate.

    Semantics note:
      Many methods describe behavior in terms of the *conceptual concatenation* of readable bytes, even if the buffer
      is physically segmented. This is what "stream-correct" means here: results must be correct regardless of how the
      buffered bytes are chunked internally.
    """

    def advance(self, n: int, /) -> None:
        """
        Consume (discard) exactly `n` readable bytes from the front of the buffer.

        This operation must not copy remaining bytes unnecessarily. For segmented buffers, this typically adjusts a head
        offset and drops exhausted segments.

        Implementations must raise if `n` is negative or greater than `len(self)`.
        """

    def split_to(self, n: int, /) -> BytesView:
        """
        Split off and return a read-only view of the first `n` readable bytes, consuming them from this buffer.

        This is the core "low-copy framing" primitive:
          - codecs can `split_to(frame_len)` to obtain a view of an entire frame without copying,
          - then immediately continue parsing subsequent frames from the remaining bytes.

        Implementations should strive for O(1) or amortized O(1) behavior, returning a view that references underlying
        segments rather than materializing a new contiguous `bytes`.

        Implementations must raise if `n` is negative or greater than `len(self)`.
        """

    def find(self, sub: bytes, start: int = 0, end: ta.Optional[int] = None) -> int:
        """
        Find the first occurrence of `sub` within the readable bytes and return its offset, or -1 if not found.

        This operation is "stream-correct": it must behave as if searching within the conceptual concatenation of all
        readable bytes, even if the buffer is physically segmented. In particular, matches that span segment boundaries
        must be detected.

        `start` and `end` are offsets into the readable region, matching the semantics of `bytes.find()`:
          - `start` defaults to 0 (the beginning of readable bytes),
          - `end` defaults to `len(self)`.

        Rationale for being part of the core interface:
          In pure Python, higher-level codecs cannot efficiently implement correct cross-segment searching byte-by-byte.
          Keeping `find` near the owning storage allows implementations to exploit contiguous segments and CPython's
          optimized search within each segment while still providing correct stream semantics.

        offsets into the readable region of this buffer.

class MutableBytesBuffer(BytesBuffer, ta.Protocol):

    A writable `BytesBuffer`: supports appending bytes and (optionally) reserving writable space.

    `MutableBytesBuffer` is the primary target for drivers/transports feeding data into protocol pipelines, and for
    encoders building outbound byte sequences. It intentionally does not imply any particular I/O model (blocking,
    asyncio, custom reactors); it is simply the mutable byte substrate.

        `readinto`) without allocating temporary `bytes` objects.

        The returned view represents capacity that is not yet part of the readable region. The caller must write into
        some prefix of the view and then call `commit(written)` to make those bytes readable.

        Implementations should document their rules regarding outstanding reservations; a simple and robust rule is:
          - only one active reservation may exist at a time,
          - mutations that would reallocate storage are forbidden while a reservation is outstanding.

        Implementations must validate:
          - that a reservation is outstanding,
          - that `0 <= n <= reserved_length`.

        After commit, the reservation is considered consumed; subsequent reads and searches must include the committed
        bytes as part of the readable region.
