    are ignored and don't end up in the result. The algorithm inserts ABCs where their functionality is introduced, i.e.

    ABCs for a given class (either registered or inferred from the presence of a special method like __len__) are
    inserted directly after the last ABC explicitly listed in the MRO of said class. If two implicit ABCs end up next to
