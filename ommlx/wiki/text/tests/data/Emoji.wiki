===Development of emoji sets (2000‚Äì2007)===
The basic 12-by-12-pixel emoji in Japan grew in popularity across various platforms over the next decade. While emoji adoption was high in Japan during this time, the competitors failed to collaborate to create a uniform set of emoji to be used across all platforms in the country.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blagdon |first1=Jeff |title=How emoji conquered the world |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/4/3966140/how-emoji-conquered-the-world |publisher=[[The Verge]] |date=March 4, 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Codepage-437 (cropped).png|thumb|Smiley faces from DOS code page 437]]
The [[Universal Coded Character Set]] ([[Unicode]]), controlled by the [[Unicode Consortium]] and [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2]], had already been established as the international standard for text representation ([[ISO/IEC 10646]]) since 1993, although variants of [[Shift JIS]] remained relatively common in Japan. Unicode included several characters which would subsequently be classified as emoji, including some from North American or Western European sources such as [[Code page 437|DOS code page 437]], [[ITC Zapf Dingbats]], or the [[WordPerfect]] Iconic Symbols set.<ref>{{cite web |title=Unicode 1.1 Emoji List |url=https://emojipedia.org/unicode-1.1/ |publisher=[[Emojipedia]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://corp.unicode.org/pipermail/unicode/2021-February/009307.html |last=Whistler |first=Ken |date=2021-02-01 |title=Re: Origins of ‚åö U+231A WATCH and ‚åõ U+231B HOURGLASS |work=Unicode Mail List Archives}}</ref> Unicode coverage of written characters was extended several times by new editions during the 2000s, with little interest in incorporating the Japanese cellular emoji sets (deemed out of scope),<ref name="principles">{{cite web |url=https://unicode.org/emoji/principles.html |title=Emoji Encoding Principles |publisher=[[Unicode Consortium]]}}</ref> although symbol characters which would subsequently be classified as emoji continued to be added.

Platforms such as [[MSN Messenger]] allowed for customisation from 2001 onwards, with many users importing emoticons to use in messages as text. These emoticons would eventually go on to become the modern-day emoji. It was not until [[MSN Messenger]] and [[BlackBerry]] noticed the popularity of these unofficial sets and launched their own from late 2003 onwards.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Li |first1=Shirley |title=The Life And Times of MSN Messenger, As Told Through MSN Emoticons |date=August 29, 2014 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/the-life-and-times-of-msn-messenger-as-told-through-msn-emoticons/379371/ |work=[[The Atlantic]]}}</ref>

In August 2007, a team made up of [[Mark Davis (Unicode)|Mark Davis]] and his colleagues Kat Momoi and Markus Scherer began petitioning the [[Unicode|Unicode Technical Committee (UTC)]] in an attempt to standardise the emoji.<ref name=wiredunicode>{{cite magazine |last1=Pardes |first1=Arielle |title=The Wired Guide to Emoji |url=https://www.wired.com/story/guide-emoji/ |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=February 1, 2018}}</ref> The UTC, having previously deemed emoji to be out of scope for Unicode, made the decision to broaden its scope to enable compatibility with the Japanese cellular carrier formats which were becoming more widespread.<ref name="principles"/> Peter Edberg and Yasuo Kida joined the collaborative effort from [[Apple Inc.]] shortly after, and their official UTC proposal came in January 2009 with 625 new emoji characters. Unicode accepted the proposal in 2010.<ref name=wiredunicode />

Pending the assignment of standard Unicode [[code point]]s, Google and Apple implemented emoji support via [[Private Use Area]] schemes. Google first introduced emoji in [[Gmail]] in October 2008, in collaboration with [[au by KDDI]],<ref name="Schwartzberg"/> and Apple introduced the first release of [[Apple Color Emoji]] to [[iPhone OS]] on 21 November 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.emojipedia.org/apple-emoji-turns-10/|title=Apple Emoji Turns 10|last=Burge|first=Jeremy|date=21 November 2018|website=Emojipedia|language=en|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref> Initially, Apple's emoji support was implemented for holders of a SoftBank SIM card; the emoji themselves were represented using SoftBank's Private Use Area scheme and mostly resembled the SoftBank designs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://emojipedia.org/apple/iphone-os-2.2/ |title=Apple iPhone OS 2.2 |work=Emojipedia |author=Emojipedia}}</ref> Gmail emoji used their own Private Use Area scheme in a [[Plane (Unicode)#Private Use Area planes|supplementary Private Use plane]].<ref name="utcL210132"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://umihotaru.work/nishiki-teki_pua.pdf |title=Nishiki-teki Version 3.90r (2021-09-25)‚Äî6,463 characters in the Private Use Areas}}</ref>

Separately, a proposal had been submitted in 2008 to add the [[ARIB STD B24 character set|ARIB extended characters]] used in broadcasting in Japan to Unicode. This included several pictographic symbols.<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1 |url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2008/08077r2-japanese-tv.pdf |title=Japanese TV Symbols |id=UTC L2/08-077R2 / ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 N3397 |last=Suignard |first=Michel |date=2008-03-11}}</ref> These were added in Unicode 5.2 in 2009, a year before the cellular emoji sets were fully added; they include several characters which either also appeared amongst the cellular emoji<ref name="utcL210132">{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2010/10132-emojidata.pdf |id=UTC L2/10-132 |title=Emoji Symbols: Background Data‚ÄîBackground data for Proposal for Encoding Emoji Symbols |first1=Markus |last1=Scherer |first2=Mark |last2=Davis |first3=Kat |last3=Momoi |first4=Darick |last4=Tong |first5=Yasuo |last5=Kida |first6=Peter |last6=Edberg}}</ref> or were subsequently classified as emoji.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://emojipedia.org/unicode-5.2/ |title=Unicode 5.2 Emoji List |work=Emojipedia |author=Emojipedia |author-link=Emojipedia}}</ref>

After iPhone users in the United States discovered that downloading Japanese [[Mobile app|apps]] allowed access to the keyboard, pressure grew to expand the availability of the emoji keyboard beyond Japan.<ref name=Cocozza2015>{{cite web|last=Cocozza|first=Paula|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/17/crying-with-laughter-how-we-learned-how-to-speak-emoji|title=Crying with laughter: how we learned how to speak emoji|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=November 17, 2015|access-date=July 28, 2017|archive-date=May 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506022028/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/17/crying-with-laughter-how-we-learned-how-to-speak-emoji|url-status=live}}</ref> The Emoji application for iOS, which altered the Settings app to allow access to the emoji keyboard, was created by [[Josh Gare]] in February 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|title=App Shopper: Emoji|url=http://appshopper.com/social-networking/emoji|website=App Shopper|access-date=2017-03-01}}</ref> Before the existence of Gare's Emoji app, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] had intended for the emoji keyboard to only be available in [[Japan]] in [[iOS]] version 2.2.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Apple releases iPhone Software v2.2|url=http://appleinsider.com/article/?id=10447|website=AppleInsider|access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref>

Throughout 2009, members of the [[Unicode Consortium]] and national standardization bodies of various countries gave feedback and proposed changes to the international standardization of the emoji. The feedback from various bodies in the United States, Europe, and Japan agreed on a set of 722 emoji as the standard set. This would be released in October 2010 in Unicode 6.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/faq/emoji_dingbats.html|title=FAQ ‚Äì Emoji & Dingbats|work=unicode.org}}</ref> Apple made the emoji keyboard available to those outside of Japan in iOS version 5.0 in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Standard Emoji keyboard arrives to iOS 5, here's how to enable it|url=https://9to5mac.com/2011/06/08/standard-emoji-keyboard-arrives-to-ios-5-heres-how-to-enable-it/|website=9to5Mac|date=June 8, 2011|access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref> Later, Unicode 7.0 (June 2014) added the [[character repertoire]]s of the [[Webdings]] and [[Wingdings]] fonts to Unicode, resulting in approximately 250 more Unicode emoji.<ref name="hexuswebdings">{{cite web| url=http://hexus.net/tech/news/software/71157-host-new-characters-emoji-introduced-unicode-70/| title=Host of New Characters and Emoji Introduced in Unicode 7.0| date=June 17, 2014| publisher=Hexus| access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref>

The Unicode emoji whose [[code point]]s were assigned in 2014 or earlier are therefore taken from several sources. A single character could exist in multiple sources, and characters from a source were unified with existing characters where appropriate: for example, the "shower" weather symbol (‚òîÔ∏è) from the ARIB source was unified with an existing umbrella with raindrops character,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2007/07391-n3341.pdf |title=Japanese TV Symbols |first=Michel |last=Suignard |date=2007-09-18 |id=UTC L2/07-391, [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2]]/WG 2 N3341}}</ref> which had been added for [[KPS 9566]] compatibility.<ref name="utc-L2-02-102">{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2002/02102-n2417-dprk.pdf |first=Asmus |last=Freytag |date=2002-02-13 |id=[[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2]]/WG 2 N2417, UTC L2/02-102 |title=Notes on proposed Symbols from DPRK}}</ref> The emoji characters named {{Nihongo|"Rain"|"Èõ®"|ame}} from all three Japanese carriers were in turn unified with the ARIB character.<ref name="utcL210132"/> However, the Unicode Consortium groups the most significant sources of emoji into four categories:<ref name="UTR51"/>

In late 2014, a Public Review Issue was created by the [[Unicode Technical Committee]], seeking feedback on a proposed Unicode Technical Report (UTR) titled "[[Unicode Emoji]]". This was intended to improve interoperability of emoji between vendors, and define a means of supporting multiple skin tones. The feedback period closed in January 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/review/pri286/ |title=Proposed Draft UTR #51, Unicode Emoji |work=Public Review Issues |id=PRI 286 |institution=[[Unicode Consortium]]}}</ref> Also in January 2015, the use of the [[zero-width joiner]] to indicate that a sequence of emoji could be shown as a single equivalent glyph (analogous to a [[ligature (writing)|ligature]]) as a means of implementing emoji without atomic code points, such as varied compositions of families, was discussed within the "emoji ad-hoc committee".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2015/15029r-zwj-emoji.pdf |title=ZWJ in emoji sequences as hint for single glyph |id=[[Unicode Technical Committee|UTC]] L2/15-029R |date=2015-01-29 |first1=Peter |last1=Edberg |author2=Emoji Ad-hoc Committee}}</ref>

Unicode 8.0 (June 2015) added another 41 emoji, including articles of sports equipment such as the cricket bat, food items such as the [[taco]], new facial expressions, and symbols for places of worship, as well as five characters (crab, scorpion, lion face, bow and arrow, amphora) to improve support for pictorial rather than symbolic representations of the signs of the [[Zodiac]].{{efn|Older [[au by KDDI]] devices had used pictorial representations of all zodiac signs, displaying for instance the [[pisces (astrology)|pisces]] sign (‚ôìÔ∏è) as a fish (üêü). Later devices had changed these to symbols, for consistency with other vendors.{{refn|{{cite web |url=https://www.au.com/content/dam/au-com/static/designs/extlib/pdf/mobile/service/featurephone/communication/emoji/taiohyo_03.pdf |title=„ÄêÁµµÊñáÂ≠óÂØæÂøúË°®„Äë Áîü„ÅçÁâ©„ÉªÊòüÂ∫ß |language=ja |publisher=[[au by KDDI]]}}}}}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/tr51-3-archive.html#Emoji_Candidates |title=Annex D: Standard Additions for Unicode 8.0 |work=Unicode Technical Report #51: Unicode Emoji |version=1.0 |date=2015-06-09 |first1=Mark |last1=Davis |author-link1=Mark Davis (Unicode) |first2=Peter |last2=Edberg |institution=[[Unicode Consortium]]}}</ref>

Also in June 2015, the first approved version ("Emoji 1.0") of the Unicode Emoji report was published as Unicode Technical Report #51 (UTR #51). This introduced the mechanism of skin tone indicators, the first official recommendations about which Unicode characters were to be considered emoji, and the first official recommendations about which characters were to be displayed in an emoji font in  the absence of a [[variation selector]], and listed the zero-width joiner sequences for families and couples that were implemented by existing vendors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/tr51-3-archive.html |title=Unicode Technical Report #51: Unicode Emoji |version=1.0 |date=2015-06-09 |first1=Mark |last1=Davis |author-link1=Mark Davis (Unicode) |first2=Peter |last2=Edberg |institution=[[Unicode Consortium]]}}</ref> Maintenance of UTR #51, taking emoji requests, and creating proposals for emoji characters and emoji mechanisms was made the responsibility of the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee (ESC), operating as a subcommittee of the Unicode Technical Committee.<ref>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150625033424/http://unicode.org/emoji/index.html#Unicode_Emoji_Subcommittee |archive-date=2015-06-25 |url-status=dead |url=http://unicode.org/emoji/index.html#Unicode_Emoji_Subcommittee |title=Unicode Emoji Subcommittee |publisher=[[Unicode Consortium]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://unicode.org/emoji/techindex.html#Unicode_Emoji_Subcommittee |title=Unicode Emoji Subcommittee |publisher=[[Unicode Consortium]]}}</ref>

With the release of version 5.0 in May 2017 alongside Unicode 10.0, UTR #51 was redesignated a Unicode Technical Standard (UTS #51), making it an independent specification.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/tr51-12.html |title=Unicode Technical Standard #51: Unicode Emoji |version=5.0 |date=2017-05-18 |first1=Mark |last1=Davis |author-link1=Mark Davis (Unicode) |first2=Peter |last2=Edberg |institution=[[Unicode Consortium]]}}</ref> {{as of|2017|July|post=,}} there were 2,666 Unicode emoji listed.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40612529| title=Emojis Honoured in World Celebration| date=July 17, 2017| publisher=BBC| access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> The next version of UTS #51 (published in May 2018) skipped to the version number Emoji 11.0 so as to synchronise its major version number with the corresponding version of the Unicode Standard.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/tr51-14.html#Versioning |title=1.5.2 Versioning |work=Unicode Technical Standard #51: Unicode Emoji |version=11.0 |date=2018-05-21 |first1=Mark |last1=Davis |author-link1=Mark Davis (Unicode) |first2=Peter |last2=Edberg |institution=[[Unicode Consortium]]}}</ref>

The popularity of emoji has caused pressure from vendors and international markets to add additional designs into the Unicode standard to meet the demands of different cultures. Some characters now defined as emoji are inherited from a variety of pre-Unicode messenger systems not only used in Japan, including [[Yahoo Messenger|Yahoo]] and [[MSN Messenger]].<ref name="Emoji Additions: Animals, Compatibility, and More Popular Requests; Emoji tranche 5">{{cite web|title=Emoji Additions: Animals, Compatibility, and More Popular Requests; Emoji tranche 5|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2015/15054r4-emoji-tranche5.pdf|publisher=Unicode|access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref> Corporate demand for emoji standardization has placed pressures on the Unicode Consortium, with some members complaining that it had overtaken the group's traditional focus on standardizing characters used for minority languages and transcribing historical records.<ref name="Inside 'Emojigeddon'">{{cite web|last1=Warzel|first1=Charlie|title=Inside 'Emojigeddon': The Fight Over The Future of the Unicode Consortium|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/inside-emojigeddon-the-fight-over-the-future-of-the-unicode|website=Buzzfeed|date=April 26, 2016 |access-date=September 15, 2017}}</ref> Conversely, the Consortium thought that public desire for emoji support has put pressure on vendors to improve their Unicode support,<ref name="detract" /> which is especially true for characters outside the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]],<ref name="backendless" /> thus leading to better support for Unicode's historic and minority scripts in deployed software.<ref name="detract" />

== Linguistic function of emoji ==
Linguistically, emoji are used to indicate emotional state; they tend to be used more in positive communication. Some researchers believe emoji can be used for [[visual rhetoric]]. Emoji can be used to set emotional tone in messages. Emoji tend not to have their own meaning but act as a [[paralanguage]], adding meaning to text. Emoji can add clarity and credibility to text.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last1=Bai |first1=Qiyu |last2=Dan |first2=Qi |last3=Mu |first3=Zhe |last4=Yang |first4=Maokun |date=2019 |title=A Systematic Review of Emoji: Current Research and Future Perspectives |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=10 |page=2221 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02221 |pmid=31681068 |pmc=6803511 |issn=1664-1078|doi-access=free }}</ref>

[[Sociolinguistics|Sociolinguistically]], the use of emoji differs depending on speaker and setting. Women use emojis more than men. Men use a wider variety of emoji. Women are more likely to use emoji in public communication than in private communication. [[Extraversion and introversion|Extraversion]] and [[agreeableness]] are positively correlated with emoji use; [[neuroticism]] is negatively correlated. Emoji use differs between cultures: studies in terms of [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory]] found that cultures with high power distance and tolerance to indulgence used more negative emoji, while those with high uncertainty avoidance, individualism, and long-term orientation use more positive emoji.<ref name=":1" /> A 6-country [[user experience]] study showed that emoji-based scales (specifically the usage of [[Smiley|smileys]]) may ease the challenges related to [[translation]] and implementation for brief cross-cultural surveys.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Sedley |first1=Aaron |url=https://www.rti.org/rti-press-publication/language-survey-research |title=Scaling the Smileys: A Multicountry Investigation (Chapter 12) in The Essential Role of Language in Survey Research |last2=Yang |first2=Yongwei |date=2020-04-30 |publisher=RTI Press |isbn=978-1-934831-24-3 |editor-last=Sha |editor-first=Mandy |doi=10.3768/rtipress.bk.0023.2004 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

==<span id="Emoji communication problems">Emoji communication problems</span>==
{{see also|Models of communication}}

Research has shown that emoji are often misunderstood. In some cases, this misunderstanding is related to how the actual emoji design is interpreted by the viewer;<ref name="DailyDotMisunderstandEmojis">{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailydot.com/debug/emoji-miscommunicate/|title=Emoji can lead to huge misunderstandings, research finds|work=Daily Dot|first=Selena|last=Larson|date=April 11, 2016|access-date=March 30, 2017}}</ref> in other cases, the emoji that was sent is not shown in the same way on the receiving side.<ref name="GrouplensEmojiMiscommunication">{{Cite web|url=https://grouplens.org/blog/investigating-the-potential-for-miscommunication-using-emoji/|title=Investigating the Potential for Miscommunication Using Emoji|publisher=Grouplens|first=Hannah|last=Miller|date=April 5, 2016|access-date=March 30, 2017}}</ref>

The first issue relates to the cultural or contextual interpretation of the emoji. When the author picks an emoji, they think about it in a certain way, but the same character may not trigger the same thoughts in the mind of the receiver.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/78kzn9/what-the-emoji-youre-sending-actually-look-like-to-your-friends| title=What the Emoji You're Sending Actually Look Like to Your Friends| date=November 12, 2015| publisher=Motherboard| access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> For example, people in China have developed a system for using emoji subversively so that a smiley face could be sent to convey a despising, mocking, and obnoxious attitude, as the [[orbicularis oculi]] (the muscle near that upper eye corner) on the face of the emoji does not move, and the [[orbicularis oris]] (the one near the mouth) tightens, which is believed to be a sign of suppressing a smile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/944693/chinese-people-mean-something-very-different-when-they-send-you-a-smiley-emoji/ |title=Chinese people mean something very different when they send you a smiley emoji |website=Quartz|date=March 29, 2017}}</ref>

The second problem relates to encodes. When an author of a message picks an emoji from a list, it is normally encoded in a non-graphical manner during the transmission, and if the author and the reader do not use the same software or operating system for their devices, the reader's device may visualize the same emoji in a different way. As an example, in April 2020, British actress and presenter [[Jameela Jamil]] posted a tweet from her iPhone using the Face with Hand Over Mouth emoji (ü§≠) as part of a comment on people shopping for food during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. On Apple's [[iOS]], the emoji expression is neutral and pensive, but on other platforms the emoji shows as a giggling face. Some fans thought that she was mocking poor people, but this was not her intended meaning.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blog.emojipedia.org/emojipedia-lookups-at-all-time-high/ |title=Emojipedia Lookups At All Time High |date=April 15, 2020 |access-date=May 9, 2020}}</ref>

Researchers from the German Studies Institute at [[Ruhr University Bochum|Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum]] found that most people can easily understand an emoji when it replaces a word directly ‚Äì like an icon for a rose instead of the word 'rose' ‚Äì yet it takes people about 50 percent longer to comprehend the emoji.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Scheffler |first1=Tatjana |last2=Brandt |first2=Lasse |last3=Fuente |first3=Marie de la |last4=Nenchev |first4=Ivan |date=February 2022 |title=The processing of emoji-word substitutions: A self-paced-reading study |journal=Computers in Human Behavior |language=en |publication-date=25 October 2021 |volume=127 |pages=107076 |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2021.107076|doi-access=free }}</ref>

===Variation and ambiguity===
Emoji characters vary slightly between platforms within the limits in meaning defined by the Unicode specification, as companies have tried to provide artistic presentations of ideas and objects.<ref name="Lost in translation: Android emoji vs iOS emoji">{{cite web|last1=Allsopp |first1=Ashleigh |title=Lost in translation: Android emoji vs iOS emoji |url=http://www.techadvisor.co.uk/opinion/mobile-phone/lost-in-translation-android-emoji-vs-ios-emoji |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228093209/http://www.techadvisor.co.uk/opinion/mobile-phone/lost-in-translation-android-emoji-vs-ios-emoji/ |archive-date=December 28, 2014 |date=December 15, 2014 |website=Tech Advisor |access-date=August 15, 2015 }}</ref> For example, following an Apple tradition, the calendar emoji on Apple products always shows July 17, the date in 2002 Apple announced its [[iCal]] calendar application for [[macOS]]. This led some Apple product users to initially nickname July 17 "[[World Emoji Day]]".<ref>{{Cite news|title = Letting Our Emojis Get in the Way|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/18/nytnow/letting-our-emojis-get-in-the-way.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 17, 2015|access-date=August 25, 2015|first=Kathryn|last=Varn}}</ref> Other emoji fonts show different dates or do not show a specific one.<ref name="Calendar emoji">{{cite web|title=Calendar emoji|url=http://emojipedia.org/calendar|website=[[Emojipedia]]|access-date=August 15, 2015}}</ref>

Some Apple emoji are very similar to the SoftBank standard, since SoftBank was the first Japanese network on which the iPhone launched. For example, {{unichar|1F483|DANCER|nlink=üíÉ}} is female on Apple and SoftBank standards but male or gender-neutral on others.<ref name="How Emoji Get Lost In Translation">{{cite news|last1=Bosker|first1=Bianca|title=How Emoji Get Lost in Translation|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/27/emoji-meaning_n_5530638.html|work=Huffington Post|date=June 27, 2014|access-date=August 15, 2015}}</ref>

Journalists have noted that the ambiguity of emoji has allowed them to take on culture-specific meanings not present in the original [[glyph]]s. For example, {{unichar|1F485|NAIL POLISH|nlink=üíÖ}} has been described as being used in English-language communities to signify "non-caring fabulousness"<ref name="How to (pretend to) be young and down with the internet">{{cite news|last1=Hern|first1=Alex|title=How to (pretend to) be young and down with the internet|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/12/how-to-be-young-internet-lol-facebook|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=August 12, 2015|access-date=August 15, 2015}}</ref> and "anything from shutting [[wikt:hater|haters]] down to a sense of accomplishment".<ref name="The 31 Most Nail Care Emoji Moments Of 2014">{{cite web|last1=Jewell|first1=Hannah|title=The 31 Most Nail Care Emoji Moments of 2014|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahjewell/the-most-nail-care-emoji-moments-of-2014|website=Buzzfeed|date=December 13, 2014|access-date=August 15, 2015}}</ref><ref name="The Five Non-Negotiable Best Emojis in the Land">{{cite web|first1=Alexander|last1=Abad-Santos|first2=Allie|last2=Jones|title=The Five Non-Negotiable Best Emojis in the Land|url=http://www.thewire.com/culture/2014/03/the-only-five-emojis-you-need/359646/|website=The Atlantic Wire|date=March 26, 2014|access-date=August 15, 2015|archive-date=August 20, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820011420/http://www.thewire.com/culture/2014/03/the-only-five-emojis-you-need/359646/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Unicode manuals sometimes provide notes on auxiliary meanings of an object to guide designers on how emoji may be used, for example noting that some users may expect {{unichar|1F4BA|SEAT}} to stand for "a reserved or ticketed seat, as for an airplane, train, or theater".<ref name="Unicode Consortium">{{cite web|title=Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs|url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/beta/nameslist/n_1F300.html|website=Unicode Consortium|access-date=September 15, 2017}}</ref>

In addition, while the original incarnations of the modern pentathlon emoji depicted its five events, including a man pointing a gun, the final glyph contains a person riding a horse, along with a laser pistol target in the corner.<ref name=AppleGun /><ref name="OlympicRifle">{{cite web |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/thanks-to-apples-influence-youre-not-getting-a-rifle-emoji |title=Thanks To Apple's Influence, You're Not Getting A Rifle Emoji |last=Warzel |first=Charlie |website=[[BuzzFeed]] |date=June 17, 2016 |access-date=October 19, 2017}}</ref><ref name=AppleStops>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/trending/rifle-emoji-dropped-unicode-9-0-update-apple-microsoft-1.3645884 |title=Apple stops Unicode from releasing a rifle emoji, gun advocates get mad |website=[[CBC News]] |date=June 22, 2016 |access-date=October 19, 2017}}</ref>

==Emoji implementation==
{{main|Implementation of Emojis}}

===Early implementation in Japan===
Various, often incompatible, character encoding schemes were developed by the different mobile providers in Japan for their own emoji sets.<ref name="utcL210132" /><ref name="EmojiSources">{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/EmojiSources.txt |title=Emoji Sources |work=Unicode Character Database |author=Unicode Consortium |author-link=Unicode Consortium}}</ref> For example, the extended [[Shift JIS]] representation F797 is used for a [[convenience store]] (üè™) by SoftBank, but for a [[wristwatch]] (‚åöÔ∏è) by KDDI.<ref name="EmojiSources" /><ref name="utcL210132" /> All three vendors also developed schemes for encoding their emoji in the Unicode [[Private Use Area]]: DoCoMo, for example, used the range U+E63E through U+E757.<ref name="utcL210132" /> Versions of [[iOS]] prior to 5.1 encoded emoji in the SoftBank private use area.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://emojipedia.org/apple/ios-5.1/ |work=[[Emojipedia]] |title=Apple iOS 5.1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://emojipedia.org/apple/iphone-os-2.2/ |work=[[Emojipedia]] |title=Apple iPhone OS 2.2}}</ref>
===Unicode support considerations===
Most, but not all, emoji are included in the [[Supplementary Multilingual Plane]] (SMP) of Unicode, which is also used for ancient scripts, some modern scripts such as [[Adlam (Unicode block)|Adlam]] or [[Osage (Unicode block)|Osage]], and special-use characters such as [[Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/smp-13-0-3.html |title=Roadmap to the SMP |first1=Michael |last1=Everson |first2=Rick |last2=McGowan |first3=Ken |last3=Whistler |first4=V.S. |last4=Umamaheswaran |date=2020-07-22 |version=Revision 13.0.3}}</ref> Some systems introduced prior to the advent of Unicode emoji were only designed to support characters in the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]] (BMP) on the assumption that non-BMP characters would rarely be encountered,<ref name="backendless">{{cite web |url=https://backendless.com/extended-string-data-type/ |title=How We Store Emojis in Your Database, or Why We Got Rid of the Extended String Data Type |first=Sergey |last=Chupov |date=2019-06-06 |publisher=Backendless Corporation}}</ref> although failure to properly handle characters outside of the BMP precludes Unicode compliance.<ref name="lundeastral">{{cite book |last=Lunde |first=Ken |year=2009 |title=CJKV Information Processing |edition=2nd |page=200 |location=Sebastopol CA. |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]] |isbn=978-0-596-51447-1}}</ref>

The introduction of Unicode emoji created an incentive for vendors to improve their support for non-BMP characters.<ref name="backendless"/> The Unicode Consortium notes that "[b]ecause of the demand for emoji, many implementations have upgraded their Unicode support substantially", also helping support minority languages that use those features.<ref name="detract">{{cite web |url=https://unicode.org/faq/emoji_dingbats.html#EO1 |title=Don't emoji detract from the other work of the consortium? |series=Frequently Asked Questions: Emoji and Pictographs |publisher=[[Unicode Consortium]]}}</ref>

===Color support===
Any operating system that supports adding additional fonts to the system can add an emoji-supporting font. However, inclusion of colorful emoji in existing font formats requires dedicated support for color [[glyphs]]. Not all operating systems have support for color fonts, so, emoji might have to be rendered as black-and-white line art or not at all. There are four different formats used for multi-color glyphs in an [[SFNT]] font,<ref name="mscolotf">{{citation|mode=cs1 |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directwrite/color-fonts#what-kinds-of-color-fonts-does-windows-support |title=Color Fonts |work=[[Microsoft Docs]] |date=2018-05-31 |author=Microsoft |author-link=Microsoft}}</ref> not all of which are necessarily supported by a given operating system library or software package such as a web browser or graphical program.<ref name="cfwt">{{cite web |url=https://www.colorfonts.wtf/#section2 |title=What's inside color fonts? |website=Color Fonts - Get ready for the revolution!}}</ref>

===Implementation by different platforms and vendors===
Apple first introduced emoji to their desktop operating system with the release of [[Mac OS X Lion|OS X 10.7 Lion]], in 2011. Users can view emoji characters sent through email and messaging applications, which are commonly shared by mobile users, as well as any other application. Users can create emoji symbols using the "Characters" special input panel from almost any native application by selecting the "Edit" menu and pulling down to "Special Characters", or by the key combination {{key press|Command|Option|T}}. The emoji keyboard was first available in Japan with the release of [[iPhone OS 2|iPhone OS version 2.2]] in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Apple releases iPhone Software v2.2|url=https://appleinsider.com/article/?id=10447|website=AppleInsider|access-date=February 28, 2017|archive-date=March 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301180231/http://appleinsider.com/article/?id=10447|url-status=dead}}</ref> The emoji keyboard was not officially made available outside of Japan until [[iOS 5|iOS version 5.0]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Standard Emoji keyboard arrives to iOS 5, here's how to enable it|url=https://9to5mac.com/2011/06/08/standard-emoji-keyboard-arrives-to-ios-5-heres-how-to-enable-it/|website=9to5Mac|date=June 8, 2011|access-date=February 28, 2017}}</ref> From iPhone OS 2.2 through to iOS 4.3.5 (2011), those outside Japan could access the keyboard but had to use a third-party app to enable it. Apple has revealed that the "face with tears of joy" is the most popular emoji among English-speaking Americans. On second place is the "heart" emoji, followed by the "Loudly Crying Face".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/03/face-with-tears-of-joy-most-popular-emoji/ |website=MacRumors |date=November 3, 2017 |first1=Joe |last1=Rossignol |title=Apple Says 'Face With Tears of Joy' is Most Popular Emoji in United States Among English Speakers|access-date=November 3, 2017|language=en}}</ref>{{Better citation needed|reason=The current source is insufficiently reliable ([[WP:NOTRS]]).|date=August 2024}}

An update for [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows Server 2008 R2]] brought a subset of the monochrome Unicode set to those operating systems as part of the ''[[Segoe|Segoe UI Symbol]]'' font.<ref name="An update for the Segoe UI symbol font in Windows 7 and in Windows Server 2008 R2 is available">{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2729094|title=An update for the Segoe UI symbol font in Windows 7 and in Windows Server 2008 R2 is available|publisher=Microsoft Support |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229143136/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2729094 |archive-date= Dec 29, 2014 }}</ref> As of [[Windows 8.1]] Preview, the ''Segoe UI Emoji'' font is included, which supplies full-color pictographs. The plain Segoe UI font lacks emoji characters, whereas Segoe UI Symbol and Segoe UI Emoji include them. Emoji characters can be accessed through the onscreen keyboard's {{key press|üòÄ}} key or through the physical keyboard shortcut {{key press|Win|.}}.

In 2016, [[Firefox]] 50 added in-browser emoji rendering for platforms lacking in native support.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/50.0/releasenotes/ | title=Firefox 50.0, See All New Features, Updates and Fixes |website=Mozilla |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240115064222/https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/50.0/releasenotes/ |archive-date= Jan 15, 2024 }}</ref>

[[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] replace all Unicode emoji used on their websites with their own custom graphics. Prior to October 2017, Facebook had different sets for the main site and for its [[Facebook Messenger|Messenger]] service, where only the former provides complete coverage. Messenger now uses Apple emoji on iOS, and the main Facebook set elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blog.emojipedia.org/facebook-discontinues-messenger-emojis/ |title=Facebook Discontinues Messenger Emojis |date=2 October 2017 |publisher=[[Emojipedia]] |first=Jeremy |last=Burge |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230924002918/https://blog.emojipedia.org/facebook-discontinues-messenger-emojis/ |archive-date= Sep 24, 2023 }}</ref> [[Facebook like button#Use on Facebook|Facebook reactions]] are only partially compatible with standard emoji.<ref>{{Cite web|title=üëç Facebook Emoji List ‚Äî Emojis and Reacts for Facebook|url=https://emojipedia.org/facebook/|access-date=2022-02-07|website=Emojipedia|language=en|quote=Facebook provides animated "emoji" reactions to posts. Reactions do not correspond to specific emojis in the Unicode standard (‚Ä¶). In March 2020, Facebook added a ''Care'' emoji reaction as an additional option in response to COVID-19. This is displayed similarly to a hugging face holding a red love heart. This ''Care emoji'' is not available as a standardized Unicode emoji, and can only be used in reactions to Facebook posts.}}</ref>

==Modifiers==
===Emoji versus text presentation===
Unicode defines [[Variant form (Unicode)|variation sequences]] for many of its emoji to indicate their desired presentation.
{{blockquote |text=Emoji characters can have two main kinds of presentation:
* an ''emoji presentation'', with colorful and perhaps whimsical shapes, even animated
* a ''text presentation'', such as black & white |source=Unicode Technical Report #51: Unicode Emoji<ref name="UTR51"/>}}

Specifying the desired presentation is done by following the base emoji with either U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15 (VS15) for text or U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16 (VS16) for emoji-style.<ref name="UniStdVarTxt">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/StandardizedVariants.txt|title=UCD: Standardized Variation Sequences|publisher=Unicode Consortium|access-date=August 17, 2016}}</ref> As of version {{Unicode version|version=15.1}} (2023), Unicode defines presentation sequences for 371 characters.<ref>[https://www.unicode.org/Public/15.1.0/ucd/emoji/emoji-variation-sequences.txt Emoji-variation-sequences.txt]</ref> However, the [[Unicode Technical Committee]] has since determined that unifying colourful emoji characters with textual symbols and dingbats was a "mistake", and resolved to allocate new [[code point]]s rather than defining new presentation sequences.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2023/23252-legacy-disunification.pdf |title=Proposal to disunify Symbols for Legacy Computing from emoji |first1=Rebecca |last1=Bettencourt |first2=Doug |last2=Ewell |id=[[Unicode Technical Committee|UTC]] L2/23-252}}</ref>

===Skin color===
{{Main|Emoji modifiers}}

Five symbol modifier characters were added with Unicode 8.0 to provide a range of skin tones for human emoji. These modifiers are called EMOJI MODIFIER FITZPATRICK TYPE-1, -2, {{not a typo|-|3}}, {{not a typo|-|4}}, {{not a typo|-|5}}, and {{not a typo|-|6}} (U+1F3FB‚ÄìU+1F3FF): <!-- Attempt to work around https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Emoji&oldid=1237246754#Technical_Glitch -->{{suppress categories|{{lang|zxx-Zsye| üèª üèº üèΩ üèæ üèø}}}}. They are based on the [[Fitzpatrick scale]] for classifying human skin color. Human emoji that are not followed by one of these five modifiers should be displayed in a generic, non-realistic skin tone, such as bright yellow (<span style="color: #ffcc22;font-size:large;">‚ñ†</span>), blue (<span style="color: #3399CC;font-size:large;">‚ñ†</span>), or gray (<span style="color: #CCCCCC;font-size:large;">‚ñ†</span>).<ref name="UTR51"/> Non-human emoji (like {{unichar|26FD|FUEL PUMP}}) are unaffected by the Fitzpatrick modifiers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://unicode.org/reports/tr51/#Emoji_Modifiers_Display |title=Unicode Technical Standard #51: Unicode Emoji ¬ß Expected Emoji Modifiers Display |date=2023-09-05 |first1=Mark |last1=Davis |author-link1=Mark Davis (Unicode) |first2=Ned |last2=Holbrook |institution=[[Unicode Consortium]]}}</ref> {{Unicode version|prefix=Asof|version=15.1}}, Fitzpatrick modifiers can be used with 131 human emoji spread across seven blocks: [[Dingbats (Unicode block)#Emoji modifiers|Dingbats]], [[Emoticons (Unicode block)#Emoji modifiers|Emoticons]], [[Miscellaneous Symbols#Emoji modifiers|Miscellaneous Symbols]], [[Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs#Emoji modifiers|Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs]], [[Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs#Emoji modifiers|Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs]], [[Symbols and Pictographs Extended-A#Emoji modifiers|Symbols and Pictographs Extended-A]], and [[Transport and Map Symbols#Emoji modifiers|Transport and Map Symbols]].<ref name="EmojiData"/>

[[File:Zero Width (Non)Joiner.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Behaviour of the {{control code link|ZWJ}} and {{control code link|ZWNJ}} format controls with various types of character, including emoji]]
Implementations may use a [[zero-width joiner]] (ZWJ) between multiple emoji to make them behave like a single, unique emoji character.<ref name="UTR51"/> For example, the sequence {{unichar|1F468|MAN}}, {{unichar|200D|ZWJ}}, {{unichar|1F469|WOMAN}}, {{unichar|200D|ZWJ}}, {{unichar|1F467|GIRL}} (üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß) could be displayed as a single emoji depicting a family with a man, a woman, and a girl if the implementation supports it. Systems that do not support it would ignore the ZWJs, displaying only the three base emoji in order (üë®üë©üëß).

{{anchor|RGI}}Unicode previously maintained a catalog of emoji ZWJ sequences that were supported on at least one commonly available platform. The consortium has since switched to documenting sequences that are ''recommended for general interchange'' (RGI). These are clusters that emoji fonts are expected to include as part of the standard.<ref name="ZWJSequences">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-zwj-sequences.html|title=Emoji ZWJ Sequences Catalog|publisher=Unicode Consortium|date=June 14, 2016}}</ref>

The ZWJ has also been used to implement platform-specific emojis. For example, in 2016, Microsoft released a series of Ninja Cat emojis for their [[Windows 10 Anniversary Update]]. The sequence {{unichar|1F431|CAT FACE}}, {{unichar|200D|ZWJ}}, {{unichar|1F464|BUST IN SILHOUETTE}} were used to create Ninja Cat (üê±‚Äçüë§).{{efn|Five other Ninja Cat emojis were released: Ninja Cat Flying (üê±‚Äçüèç), Ninja Cat at Computer (üê±‚Äçüíª), Ninja Cat riding T-Rex (üê±‚Äçüêâ), Ninja Cat with Coffee (üê±‚Äçüëì) and Ninja Cat in Space (üê±‚ÄçüöÄ).}}<ref name="Burge">{{cite web|url=https://blog.emojipedia.org/ninja-cat-the-windows-only-emoji/#fn1|title=Ninja Cat: The Windows-only Emoji|last=Burge|first=Jeremy|date=April 11, 2016|work=[[Emojipedia]]|access-date=5 June 2022}}</ref> Ninja Cat and variants were removed in late 2021's ''Fluent'' emoji redesign.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://emojipedia.org/ninja-cat/|title=Ninja Cat|work=[[Emojipedia]]|access-date=5 June 2022}}</ref>
