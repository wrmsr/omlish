NLP From Scratch: Classifying Names with a Character-Level RNN
**************************************************************
**Author**: `Sean Robertson <https://github.com/spro>`_

We will be building and training a basic character-level Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) to classify words. This tutorial, along with two other
Natural Language Processing (NLP) "from scratch" tutorials
:doc:`/intermediate/char_rnn_generation_tutorial` and
:doc:`/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial`, show how to
preprocess data to model NLP. In particular these tutorials do not
use many of the convenience functions of `torchtext`, so you can see how
preprocessing to model NLP works at a low level.

A character-level RNN reads words as a series of characters -
outputting a prediction and "hidden state" at each step, feeding its
previous hidden state into each next step. We take the final prediction
to be the output, i.e. which class the word belongs to.

Specifically, we'll train on a few thousand surnames from 18 languages
of origin, and predict which language a name is from based on the
spelling:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ python predict.py Hinton
    (-0.47) Scottish
    (-1.52) English
    (-3.57) Irish

    $ python predict.py Schmidhuber
    (-0.19) German
    (-2.48) Czech
    (-2.68) Dutch


Recommended Preparation
=======================

Before starting this tutorial it is recommended that you have installed PyTorch,
and have a basic understanding of Python programming language and Tensors:

-  https://pytorch.org/ For installation instructions
-  :doc:`/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz` to get started with PyTorch in general
   and learn the basics of Tensors
-  :doc:`/beginner/pytorch_with_examples` for a wide and deep overview
-  :doc:`/beginner/former_torchies_tutorial` if you are former Lua Torch user

It would also be useful to know about RNNs and how they work:

-  `The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural
   Networks <https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/>`__
   shows a bunch of real life examples
-  `Understanding LSTM
   Networks <https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/>`__
   is about LSTMs specifically but also informative about RNNs in
   general

Preparing the Data
==================

.. note::
   Download the data from
   `here <https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/data.zip>`_
   and extract it to the current directory.

Included in the ``data/names`` directory are 18 text files named as
``[Language].txt``. Each file contains a bunch of names, one name per
line, mostly romanized (but we still need to convert from Unicode to
ASCII).

We'll end up with a dictionary of lists of names per language,
``{language: [names ...]}``. The generic variables "category" and "line"
(for language and name in our case) are used for later extensibility.

# Turning Names into Tensors
# --------------------------
#
# Now that we have all the names organized, we need to turn them into
# Tensors to make any use of them.
#
# To represent a single letter, we use a "one-hot vector" of size
# ``<1 x n_letters>``. A one-hot vector is filled with 0s except for a 1
# at index of the current letter, e.g. ``"b" = <0 1 0 0 0 ...>``.
#
# To make a word we join a bunch of those into a 2D matrix
# ``<line_length x 1 x n_letters>``.
#
# That extra 1 dimension is because PyTorch assumes everything is in
# batches - we're just using a batch size of 1 here.
#


# Find letter index from all_letters, e.g. "a" = 0
def letter_to_index(letter):
    return all_letters.find(letter)


# Just for demonstration, turn a letter into a <1 x n_letters> Tensor
def letter_to_tensor(letter):
    tensor = torch.zeros(1, n_letters)
    tensor[0][letter_to_index(letter)] = 1
    return tensor


# Turn a line into a <line_length x 1 x n_letters>,
# or an array of one-hot letter vectors
def line_to_tensor(line):
    tensor = torch.zeros(len(line), 1, n_letters)
    for li, letter in enumerate(line):
        tensor[li][0][letter_to_index(letter)] = 1
    return tensor


print(letter_to_tensor('J'))

print(line_to_tensor('Jones').size())

# Creating the Network
# ====================
#
# Before autograd, creating a recurrent neural network in Torch involved
# cloning the parameters of a layer over several timesteps. The layers
# held hidden state and gradients which are now entirely handled by the
# graph itself. This means you can implement a RNN in a very "pure" way,
# as regular feed-forward layers.
#
# This RNN module (mostly copied from `the PyTorch for Torch users
# tutorial <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/former_torchies/
# nn_tutorial.html#example-2-recurrent-net>`__)
# is just 2 linear layers which operate on an input and hidden state, with
# a ``LogSoftmax`` layer after the output.
#

# Training
# ========
# Preparing for Training
# ----------------------
#
# Before going into training we should make a few helper functions. The
# first is to interpret the output of the network, which we know to be a
# likelihood of each category. We can use ``Tensor.topk`` to get the index
# of the greatest value:
#

def category_from_output(output):
    top_n, top_i = output.topk(1)
    category_i = top_i[0].item()
    return all_categories[category_i], category_i

######################################################################
# We will also want a quick way to get a training example (a name and its
# language):

######################################################################
# Training the Network
# --------------------
#
# Now all it takes to train this network is show it a bunch of examples,
# have it make guesses, and tell it if it's wrong.
#
# For the loss function ``nn.NLLLoss`` is appropriate, since the last
# layer of the RNN is ``nn.LogSoftmax``.
#

criterion = nn.NLLLoss()

######################################################################
# Each loop of training will:
#
# -  Create input and target tensors
# -  Create a zeroed initial hidden state
# -  Read each letter in and
#
#    -  Keep hidden state for next letter
#
# -  Compare final output to target
# -  Back-propagate
# -  Return the output and loss
#

# -  Try with a different dataset of line -> category, for example:
#
#    -  Any word -> language
#    -  First name -> gender
#    -  Character name -> writer
#    -  Page title -> blog or subreddit

# -  Get better results with a bigger and/or better shaped network
